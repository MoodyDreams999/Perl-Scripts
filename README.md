# Perl-Scripts
These are perl scripts that I use at work.

Script 1: DupCount - This script reads two files and takes a count of the duplicates in file1 and a count of the duplicates in file2, and then it takes another count of the duplicates by comparing file 2 to file 1. The script then outputs the totals of those duplicates.
