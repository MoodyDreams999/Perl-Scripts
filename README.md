# Perl-Scripts
These are perl scripts that I use at work.

Script 1: DupCount - This script reads two files and takes a count of the duplicates in file1 and a count of the duplicates in file2, and then it takes another count of the duplicates by comparing file 2 to file 1. The script then outputs the totals of those duplicates.

Script 2 NumbersCleaner3 which includes DNCExtractor and DuplicateHandler as I didnt want to put too many iterations on one script. This script is meant to make sure there are no extra Do not Call numbers after using the blacklist alliance to check numbers against litagators and the federal Do not call lists.
